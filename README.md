Seamlessly consolidate multiple drive sources into one unified, elegant sidebar.
*   **Mount Unlimited Drives:** Add Team Drives, Shared Drives, or folders belonging to other accounts as shortcuts.
*   **Folder Aliases:** Rename long or complex drive folder names to something readable (e.g., *backup-2024-xyz* -> "Work Backup").

## 🚀 Complete Deployment Guide

### Step 1: Google Cloud API Setup
This is required to allow Zee-Index to communicate with your Google Drive.

1.  Open [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). Create a **New Project**.
2.  Go to **APIs & Services > Library**. Search for **Google Drive API** and click **Enable**.
3.  Go to **Credentials > Create Credentials > OAuth Client ID**.
    *   **Application Type:** Web Application.
    *   **Name:** `Zee-Index Production`.
    *   **Authorized Redirect URIs:** 
        *   (Local) `http://localhost:3000/setup`
        *   (Prod) `https://YOUR-VERCEL-DOMAIN.vercel.app/setup` (Add this later after Vercel deployment).
4.  Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel
Deploy automatically without touching a single line of code.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fifauzeee%2FZee-Index&env=GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,NEXT_PUBLIC_ROOT_FOLDER_ID,NEXTAUTH_SECRET,SHARE_SECRET_KEY,ADMIN_EMAILS,KV_REST_API_URL,KV_REST_API_TOKEN,SMTP_HOST,SMTP_USER,SMTP_PASS,EMAIL_FROM)

**Crucial Step:** When setting up the project in Vercel, ensure you click **"Create"** under the **Storage (Database)** section to set up **KV (Redis)**.

### Step 3: Setup Wizard (Auto-Config)
1.  After deployment succeeds, open your website URL.
2.  The page will automatically redirect to `/setup`.
3.  Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** again to verify.
4.  Click **Authorize**. Sign in with your main Google Drive account.
5.  Grant permissions. **Done!** The refresh token is now securely stored in the database.

## ⚠️ Security FAQ & Troubleshooting (Important!)

**Q: When I access a Protected Folder URL, the Folder ID is visible in the browser Address Bar. Is this safe?**

*   Example: `https://zee-index.app/folder/1xZ3KKvKMPg5...`
*   **Concern:** Can't someone copy `1xZ3KKvKMPg5...` and try to open it directly via `drive.google.com`?

**Answer:**
This is by design and safe, provided you follow the setup below:

1.  **Dual Layer Protection:** Zee-Index is purely a *frontend/interface* layer. Security relies on the **Google Drive Permission Settings**.
    *   **MANDATORY:** Ensure the folders you protect in Zee-Index have their permission set to **"Restricted"** in Google Drive (not "Anyone with the link").
    *   If Restricted: Even if someone knows the ID, they **cannot open it** directly in Google Drive ("Access Denied").
    *   Zee-Index can open it because the server uses your authenticated Admin credentials to fetch the data.

2.  **Why isn't the URL masked/hidden? (Technical Reason):**
    We previously attempted to mask folder IDs (e.g., rewriting the URL to `/protected-folder`). This feature was removed (refer to commit `a04023c`) due to a critical issue:
    *   When a user is on the Password Entry page and hits **Refresh (F5)**, the Next.js server would return a **404 Not Found** error because the "masked" route does not physically exist on the server.
    *   To ensure application stability and reliable routing, we retain the original dynamic routing structure.

**Q: I forgot the Folder Password?**
*   Log in as Admin -> Go to **Dashboard** -> **Security Tab**. There, you can reset or remove the password for any protected folder.
